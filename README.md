## The Kotlin example app

This Kotlin example app teaches the very basics of how to work with Contentful and GraphQL for Android:

- consume content from the Contentful GraphQL API using Apollo
- model content
- edit content through the Contentful web app

The app demonstrates how decoupling content from its presentation enables greater flexibility and facilitates shipping higher quality software more quickly.

## What is Contentful?

[Contentful](https://www.contentful.com) provides a content infrastructure for digital teams to power content in websites, apps, and devices. Unlike a CMS, Contentful was built to integrate with the modern software stack. It offers a central hub for structured content, powerful management and delivery APIs, and a customizable web app that enable developers and content creators to ship digital products faster.

## Common setup

Clone the repo and install the dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/contentful/the-example-app.graphql.kotlin.git
```

Open Android Studio and create a new project from the just downloaded source.


## Steps for read-only access

Open `gradle.build` in Android Studio and run the app on an emulator or directly on a device.
